##Game Description

###Menu
The game’s menu contains four options:

- **PLAY**: starts the game
- **CONTROLS**: Leads to screen with controls explanation
- **HIGHSCORE**: List of highscore records
- **EXIT**: Closes the console game

###Gameplay
The player controls a horizontally and vertically moving warrior on the console while random-moving enemies are trying to shoot him down. The enemies must be hit 3 times and then they are dead. After a certain number of points is achieved the game becomes more difficult (the enemies are moving and shooting faster).
The aim of the game is to defeat all enemies by shooting them with the gun and stay alive. At the beginning the player has four lives and earns point by shooting the enemies. An enemy can be killed with at least 3 precise shots.
